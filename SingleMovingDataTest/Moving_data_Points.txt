Moving_data_Points

I need to create 11 different distance data points for all sensors to move along the x-axis to verify that the multilateration code is working fine.

Points will be at (0,2.5), (0.5,2.5), (1,2.5), (1.5,2.5), (2,2.5), (2.5,2.5), (3,2.5), (3.5,2.5), (4,2.5), (4.5,2.5), (5,2.5)
